## Micro-Mouse Sensor Module

This repository contains the design files, code, and documentation for the sensor module of a micro-mouse robot. The goal is to create a compact, low-power sensor module that effectively detects obstacles (walls) within a maze environment, aiding the robot's navigation.

**Features:**

* Obstacle detection (walls, corners) using chosen sensor technology (to be determined)
* Communication with the provided processor board (STM32L476)
* Compact design for efficient integration within the micro-mouse
* Low power consumption for extended battery life

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/
```

2. **Software Dependencies:**

The provided code might have dependencies on specific libraries for sensor communication or data processing. 

3. **Hardware Requirements:**

* Refer to the `hardware` folder for component selection and potential Bill of Materials (BOM).
*  Additional components like soldering equipment, breadboard (for testing), and power supply will be necessary for assembly.

**Documentation:**

* **Requirements Analysis:** An analysis of the system requirements and specifications can be found in the interim final reportpdf file.
* **Design Report:** The `doc/interim_design_report.pdf` file details the sensor module design decisions, component selection, and testing procedures.
* **Schematics and PCB Layout:** The KiCad project files for the sensor module PCB are located in the `pcb` folder.

**Testing:**

The provided code might include unit tests for sensor communication and data processing functionalities.
